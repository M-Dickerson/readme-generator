# Readme Generator

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this project was to create an index.js file that can generate a readme through a series of prompts. It solves the issue of not being able to easily generate a readme locally through our machines. I learned about node and how to properly install it, as well as creating a toggle menu through node.
